    "1. **A class is a blueprint** for creating objects\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`__init__`** runs automatically when you create an object - use it to set up attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`self`** refers to the current object - use it to store and access attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Attributes** are variables that belong to an object (`self.title`, `self.year`, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`__str__`** defines what happens when you print an object\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Objects are independent** - changing one doesn't affect others made from the same class"
